            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>Lex Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentaria,</hi> or <hi>Parliamentary Law,</hi> cannot be meant or intended to ſignify any Preſcription or Application of Laws to that Power, which in itſelf is boundleſs, and unlimited: This Collection, therefore, only ſhews what Parliaments have done, and not what they may or ought to do. The Parliament alone can judge of ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as concern their own Rights, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, or Privileges.</p>
            <p>And yet, ſeeing the Phraſe, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Law, or Law of Parliaments, has for ſome Ages paſt obtained,<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> Sir <hi>Matth. Hales</hi>'s <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> (and that too among Authors of great Name,) I hope the preſent, or any future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not cenſure me for a Word (miſapplied,) or for endeavouring to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate that Authority which is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly denominated Parliamentary Law. The Parliament itſelf is, no doubt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be ſtiled, <hi>The fundamental Law and Conſtitution of this Kingdom, as it comprehends all</hi> Legal Powers <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97470:4"/>
            <p>But as God and Nature influenced the Voice and Deſires of the People to this Form of Government by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo it muſt be confeſſed that the ſame ſupream Power alſo influenced their Voices and Deſires, to eſtabliſh this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Government for the Safety and Preſervation of the Governed, and thereby conſtituted the <hi>Salus Populi</hi> to be the ſupream Law; to whoſe Support all other Laws, Powers, and Authorities ought to tend. 'Tis for this End Kings are created; and for this End Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aſſemble; that ſo the Polity and Government of the Nation may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered with Honour and with Safety, for the Good of the whole Community.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied, but that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in former Times eſteem'd it as their moſt incumbent temporal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to overſee, recognize, and reſirain, within the Bounds of Law, the Commands and Acts of Kings; and to take care that that great and honourable Truſt repoſed in the Hands of the Prince, for the Good of the People, might be rightly and duly adminiſtered, and not perverted or abuſed to the Invaſion of their Rights, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Conſtitution.<note place="margin">Brac, p. 34 Flet p. 2.17. vide hic, p. 89.</note> 'Twas the Senſe of this Duty of Parliaments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced both <hi>Bracton,</hi> an eminent Judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>Henry III.</hi> and <hi>Fleta,</hi> a learned
<pb facs="tcp:97470:4"/>Lawyer in King <hi>Edward I's</hi> Time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord this great Duty of Parliaments to ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>And from this very Motive it was,<note place="margin">See the Preface to Privilegia Londini. p. 6, 7.</note> that our antient Parliaments were ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as to oblige our Kings to ſwear at their Coronations, <hi>Concedere juſtas Leges quas vulgus elegerit;</hi> That they would grant ſuch juſt Laws as the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould chooſe. (See this Oath admirably well explained in <hi>Sadler's</hi> Rights of the Kingdom. <hi>Page 71, 88, 91. &amp;c.</hi>)</p>
            <p>From all which, and much more, that may be added, I think it clearly appears, That both Kings and Parliaments, Lords and Commons, and all Laws of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever, were in their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention inſtituted and ordained for the ſole Good and Benefit of the People; And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all or any of them are perverted from that View, they looſe the Nature of their firſt Intention, and ought to receive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Denomination.</p>
            <p>And from the foregoing Particulars, I at preſent apprehend, that the <hi>Lex Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaria,</hi> or <hi>Fundamental Law of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in this Nation, was not originally founded on any Capitulation or Compact between the King and the People, as is uſually done in Contracts of Bargains and Sales, or other Purchaſes; For that would infer a ſeparate Intereſt between Prince and People. But who will ſay, that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarch can by Law have a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Intereſt from his People?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97470:5"/>
            <p>Alſo the mutual Obligation that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between the Prince and People by the Laws of this Kingdom, have laid an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable Bar againſt any ſuch Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, or contracting Project: For by the original and inherent Nature of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is ſuch amutual Relation and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Connection created between the King and his People, as in that natural Relation and Connection between the Head and the Members of the Body; ſo that in neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can the Head ſay to the Members, <hi>I have no need of you,</hi> &amp;c. This mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between Prince and People ſeems to have been interwoven in the fundamental Being, and impreſſed in the very Heart of our Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Publiſher here thinks fit to declare, That this Book has received no little Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from a Manuſcript of that judicious and learned Judge, the late Mr. <hi>Juſtice Price,</hi> who, having been many Years a Member of the Houſe of Commons, had made divers curious hiſtorical Collections, with ſeveral Notes and References relating to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter hereof: And in this Edition, the Reader may find (collected from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records and Hiſtories) all that is neceſſary to be known, touching the Rights and Privileges of Parliaments; and, in a great Meaſure, the legal Prerogatives of the Prince, and juſt Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

               <p>Indeed, the Practice of increaſing the Number of the Repreſentatives of the Commons,<note place="margin">See Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hun's Col. per Tot.</note> began very early, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, That all their Folkmotes, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Aſſemblies, being generally held twice yearly, at certain particular Places, and on certain ſtated Days, or Times in the Year, there was no Occaſion for any ſpecial Notice to be given of, or any Summons to thoſe Aſſemblies, no more than for the Terms at this Day.

               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Vide Edv.

               <p>THE Parliament is the Foundation and Baſis of Government,<note place="margin">Ruſhw Coll. 3d Part Vol. 1. fo. 739</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the Peace and Happineſs of the Kingdom; as it creates the Law by which we are ruled and governed in Peace and Quietneſs; ſo it preſerves the Law in Power and Authority: It watches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Religion, that it be not ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exchanged by ſuppoſitious Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; or the Truth and Subſtance of it eaten up with Formality, vain Pomp, and unneceſſary Ceremonies. It is the <hi>Conſervative</hi> of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject, and the <hi>Corrective</hi> of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, which by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Right is diſtributed to all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man hath that Benefit and Protection of Juſtice which is due to him. It is that by which alone common Neceſſities can be provided for, and Publick Fears prevented; ſo that I may ſay, not only the Peace and Happineſs, and well Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the very Being of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, can have no other Bottom to ſtand
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97470:31"/>upon, but the Parliament; it being the Foundation upon which the whole Frame of the Commonwealth is built.</p>
               <p>The Parliament is the Cabinet,<note place="margin">Ib. 201.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the chiefeſt Jewels both of the Crown and Kingdom are depoſited.

               <p>Parliaments are the Ground and Pillar of the Subject's Liberty,<note place="margin">Ib. 587.</note> and that which only maketh <hi>England</hi> a free Monarchy.</p>

               <p>It is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">4 Inſt. 2.</note> That when there is beſt Appearance, there is the beſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Parliament.

               <p>When a Parliament is call'd,<note place="margin">Ib. 28.</note> and doth ſit, and is diſſolved, without any Act of Parliament paſſed, or Judgment given, it is no <hi>Seſſion of Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Houſe of Lords in general.</head>
               <p>THE Houſe of Peers,<note place="margin">Ruſhw. eol. vol. 3. part. 1. p. 777.</note> are the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Counſellors of the (King and) Kingdom, as the Houſe of Commons are the repreſentative Body of the whole Commons of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>There certainly cannot in the whole World be ſeen a more illuſtrious Court,<note place="margin">Nalſon, <hi>566.</hi>
                  </note> than this high and honourable Aſſembly of Peers in Parliament; nor any Thing of greater Benefit and Advantage to the Subjects of this Monarchy.</p>
               <p>No Lord of Parliament can ſit there,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Simon d'Ewes</hi>'s Jour. 11. Col. 1.</note> till he be full One and twenty Years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſpecial Grace of the Prince; and that very rarely, unleſs they be near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Age of Twenty one Years at leaſt.</p>
               <p>A Biſhop elect may ſit in Parliament,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>ante</hi> 3, 4, 43, 44.</note> as a Lord thereof, (<hi>i. e.</hi> if called thereto by Writ,) Q. For he is not properly a Peer, (or even a Biſhop,) till his Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties are granted to him.</p>
               <p>If the King by his Writ calleth any Knight or Eſquire to be a Lord of the Parliament,<note place="margin">4 Inſt. 44.</note> he cannot refuſe to ſerve the King there <hi>in communi illo Conſilio,</hi> for the Good of his Country.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:97470:51"/>
               <p>It lies in the Favour of the Prince,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Simon d'Ewes</hi> Journal, 2.4. Col. 2.</note> to make Heirs of Earldoms Members of the upper Houſe, by ſummoning them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Writ; but then they take not their Place there as the Sons of Earls, but according to the Antiquity of their Fathers Baronies.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is the firſt Peer of the Realm.<note place="margin">Id. 140. Col. 1.</note>

               </p>
               <p>No Man ought to ſit in that high Court of Parliament,<note place="margin">4 Inſt. 45.</note> but he that hath Right to ſit there.</p>
               <p>If a Lord depart from Parliament,<note place="margin">Id. 44.</note> without Licenſe, it is an Offence done out of the Parliament, and is finable by the Law.</p>

               <p>A Proxy is no more than the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome one or more by an abſent Lord,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Simon d'Ewes</hi> Journals 5.

               <p>As many Proxies as any Peer hath,<note place="margin">Ibid.

               <p>It appeareth plainly by many Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,<note place="margin">Id. 176, 177.</note> that all Judgments for Life and Death, are to be render'd by the Steward of <hi>England,</hi> or by the Steward of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Houſe;</hi> and this is the Reaſon, why at every Parliament the King makes a Lord Steward of his <hi>Houſe,</hi> tho' he hath none out of Parliament.

               <p>In Caſe of Recovery of Damages,<note place="margin">Id. 187.</note> or Reſtitution, the Parties are to have their Remedy (the Parliament being ended) in

               <p>An Eminent and Noble Author, has in his <hi>Diſcourſes on Government,</hi> aſſerted that the <hi>Power of calling and diſſolving Parliaments, is not ſimply in our Kings alone.</hi> And in ſupport of this Aſſertion, gives us the following Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſays he) the King can have no ſuch Power, unleſs it be given him; (by Law) for <hi>every Man is naturally Free;</hi> and the ſame Power that makes him King, gives him all that belongs to his being King, and no more: 'Tis not therefore an Inherent, but only a Delegated Power; and whoever Receives it, is accountable to thoſe who gave it; for they who give Authority by Commiſſion, do always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more than they Grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law for Annual Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expreſly Declares it, not to be in the King's Power as to their Meeting; nor conſequently as to their Continuance; for they meet to no Purpoſe if they may not continue to do the Work for which they meet; and it were abſur'd to give them a Power of Meeting; if they might
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97470:62"/>not continue till the End for which they met were attained; <hi>Qui Dat Finem Dat Media ad Finem Neceſſaria;</hi> the only Reaſon (End) why Parliaments do Meet, is to provide for the publick Good, and they ought to Meet (and continue) for that End; they ought not therefore to be Diſſolved till it be accompliſhed; and 'twas for this Reaſon, that the Opinion given by <hi>Treſilian,</hi> that Kings might Diſſolve Parliaments at their Pleaſure,<note place="margin">Note.</note> was adjudg'd to be a principal part of his Treaſon.</p>
               <p>See other Reaſons there Aſſign'd; and on the whole he concludes, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have in themſelves a Power of Meeting, Sitting and Acting for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</p>
               <p>After which,<note place="margin">Ibid p. 432.</note> he further Proſecutes the ſame Point, and then proceeds to ſhew; That as the Peoples Delegatees or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in Parliament do not meet there by a Power derived from Kings, but from thoſe that chuſe them; ſo they who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate Powers, do always retein to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more than they give; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People do not give their Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates an abſolute Power of doing what they pleaſe, but do always retein to themſelves more than they confer on their Deputies, who muſt therefore be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Principalls. <hi>Vide plura ibid.</hi>

               <p>It is true,<note place="margin">4 Inſt. 8. <hi>Smyth</hi>'s Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth 75. See <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hun</hi>'s Coll. 352. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</note> the Commons are to chooſe their Speaker; but ſeeing that after their Choice the King may refuſe him; for avoiding of expence of Time and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, the Uſe is (as in the <hi>Conge d'Eſlier</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi>) that the King doth name a diſcret and learned Man, whom the Commons elect.</p>
               <p>But without their Election no Speaker can be appointed for them,<note place="margin">4 Inſt. 8.</note> becauſe he is their Mouth, and truſted by them, and ſo neceſſary, as the Houſe of Commons cannot ſit without him.</p>
               <p>And therefore a grievous Sickneſs is a good Cauſe to remove the Speaker,<note place="margin">Id. 8.</note> and chooſe another. So in 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.

               <p>Surely the Election of the Speaker was antiently free to the Commons,<note place="margin">Id. 155.</note> to chooſe whom they would of their own Houſe; which appears in this, that the King never rejected any whom they made Choice of.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97470:151"/>who remain ſitting in the Houſe: and then to ſtand within the Door, two on the one Side, and two on the other, and to count the Number of them who went forth, as they come in.</p>
               <p>While the Houſe is thus divided,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or dividing, no Member may ſpeak, nor (unleſs it be to go forth upon the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) remove out of his Place.</p>
               <p>When the Houſe is thus told,<note place="margin">Id 27.</note> thoſe two of the Tellers, who are of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who have the major Votes, ſtanding on the right Hand, and the two other on the left Hand at the Bar (the reſt being all ſet in their Places) are to come from thence up to the Table toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (making the uſual Obeyſance to the Houſe three Times; once at the Bar, again in the middle of the Houſe, and again when they are come to the Table) and that Perſon who ſtands on the right Hand, is to declare to the Speaker the Number of the <hi>Yea's</hi> (who ſat, or went out, as the Caſe is) and of the <hi>No's:</hi> and then with like Reverence to depart into their Places; after which, Mr. Speaker is to report the ſame to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>If the Affirmative have the major Votes by the Judgment of the Speaker,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or (in caſe of Diviſion) upon the Diviſion; the Clerk is to enter the Vote, <hi>Reſolved.</hi> If the Negatives, then he is to enter it

               <p>If upon a Debate it be much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,<note place="margin">Id. 28.</note> and much be ſaid againſt the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; any Member may move, that the Queſtion may be firſt made, whether that Queſtion ſhall be put, or whether it ſhall be now put; which uſually is admitted at the Inſtance of any Member, eſpecially if it be ſeconded, and inſiſted on: and if that Queſtion being put, it paſs in the Affirmative; then the main Queſtion is to be put immediately, and no Man may ſpeak any thing further to it, either to add, or alter. But before the Queſtion (whether the Queſtion ſhall be put) any Perſon, who hath not formerly ſpoken to the main Queſtion, hath liberty to ſpeak

               <p>If in a Debate there ariſe more Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions than one, and it be controverted,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which Queſtion ſhould be firſt put; the Queſtion firſt moved and ſeconded is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to be firſt put, unleſs it be laid aſide by general Conſent. If the firſt Queſtion be inſiſted on to be put, and the major Part ſeem to be againſt it, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is to be, whether that Queſtion ſhall be now put: if that paſs in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then the other Queſtion may be put, if deſired: nevertheleſs any Perſon may ſpeak to it again, before it be put. If in the Affirmative, then it is to be put without any Addition or Alteration, as before: and after the Queſtion is put, if any Member move to have the other Queſtion put, every one hath leave to ſpeak to it again, as if it were a new Queſtion.</p>
               <p>If a Matter be received into Debate,<note place="margin">Id. 29</note> and a Queſtion grow, whether the Houſe ſhall proceed in that Debate at this time, and it fall out, that the Houſe be divided; in ſuch Caſe the <hi>No's</hi> are to go forth (it being contrary to the Courſe of the Houſe, that any Buſineſs ſhou'd be laid aſide 'till it be determined by a Queſtion) if the Queſtion be for an Adjournment of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97470:153"/>the <hi>Yea's</hi> are to go forth upon the ſame Reaſon.</p>
               <p>After a Queſtion is propounded,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> no Man may ſpeak more than once to the Matter; but having ſpoken to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the Queſtion comes to be put, he may ſpeak to the Manner or Words of the Queſtion, keeping himſelf to that only, and not ravelling into the Merits of it.</p>
               <p>If a Queſtion upon a Debate contain more Parts than one,<note place="margin">Ibid</note> and the Members ſeem to be for one Part, and not for the other; it may be moved, that the ſame may be divided into two, or more Queſtions: as <hi>Dec.</hi> 2. 1640, the Debate about the Election of two Knights was divided into two Queſtions.</p>

And ſo the <hi>Speaker</hi> took it.</p>

               <p>Any Member of the Houſe may offer a Bill for Publick Good,<note place="margin">Scobel <hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> except it be for impoſing a Tax; which is not to be done, but by Order of the Houſe firſt had.</p>
               <p>If any Member deſire,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that an Act made, and in Force, may be repealed or altered, he is firſt to move the Houſe in it, and have their Reſolution, before any Bill to that Purpoſe may be offer'd; and if upon the Reaſons ſhew'd, for repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97470:160"/>or altering ſuch Law, the Houſe ſhall think it fit, they do uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point one or more of the Members to bring in a Bill for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Speaker</hi> is not preciſely bound to any of theſe Rules,<note place="margin">Hakewel <hi>136.</hi>
                  </note> for the preferring of Bills to be read or paſſed; but is left to his own good Diſcretion (except he be ſpecially directed by the Houſe to the contrary) and tho he be earneſtly preſſed by the Houſe for the reading of ſome one Bill; yet if he have not had conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Time to read the ſame over, and to make a <hi>Breviat</hi> thereof for his own Memory; the <hi>Speaker</hi> doth claim a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to defer the Reading thereof to ſome other Time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clerk</hi> being uſually directed by the <hi>Speaker</hi> (but ſometime by the Houſe) what Bill to read,<note place="margin">Hakewel <hi>137.</hi>
                  </note> with a loud and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Voice firſt reads the Title of the Bill, and then, after a little Pauſe, the Bill it ſelf; which done, kiſſing his Hand, he delivereth the ſame to the <hi>Speaker;</hi> who ſtandeth up uncover'd (whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he ſitteth with his Hat on) and holding the Bill in his Hand, ſaith, <hi>The Bill is thus intituled,</hi> and then readeth the Title; which done, he openeth to the Houſe the Subſtance of the Bill, which he doth, either truſting to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or uſing the Help, or altogether

               <p>The uſual Courſe is to ſpend the Morning, before the Houſe grow full,<note place="margin">Id. 139.</note> in the firſt Readings, and to defer the ſecond or third Reading till the Houſe grow full.</p>
               <p>All Men of Law know, that a Bill,<note place="margin">Town. Cal. <hi>238.</hi>
                  </note> which is only expoſitory, to expound the Common Law, doth enact nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any <hi>Proviſo</hi> good therein.</p>

               <p>At the firſt Reading of the Bill,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hakewel</hi> 139.</note> it is not the Courſe for any Man to ſpeak to it, but rather to conſider of it, and to take Time till the ſecond Reading; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it carry Matter of apparent Hurt to the Commonwealth, and ſo to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Nor for any Addition,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for thereby it is imply'd, That the Body of the Bill is good, which till the ſecond Reading, doth not regularly come to the Trial.</p>
               <p>If any Bill originally begun in the Commons Houſe,<note place="margin">Id. 140. <hi>Scobel</hi> 42.</note> upon the firſt Reading happen to be debated too and fro, and that upon the Debate, the Houſe do call for the Queſtion; it ought to be, not <hi>Whether the Bill ſhall be read the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Time</hi> (for ſo it ought to be in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe) but <hi>whether it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Bill coming from the Lords be ſpoken againſt,<note place="margin">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97470:161"/>then for Rejection. But uſually when any ſuch Debate is, the <hi>Speaker</hi> doth forbear to make any Queſtion at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, except he be much preſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it being better to conſider of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be put to ſuch a Hazard.</p>
               <p>If the Queſtion for Rejection be made,<note place="margin">Id. 141. <hi>Scobel</hi> 42.</note> and the greater Voice be to have it reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the <hi>Clerk</hi> ought to note it rejected in his <hi>Journal,</hi> and ſo to indorſe it on the Back of the Bill; and it ſhall be no more read: If the Voice be to have the Bill retained, it ſhall have his ſecond Reading in Courſe.</p>
               <p>It is againſt the ordinary Courſe that the ſame Bill ſhou'd be read more than once in one Day,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but for ſpecial Reaſons it hath been ſuffer'd, that private Bills have been in one Day read twice.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe done ſometimes,<note place="margin">Hakewell <hi>142</hi>

               <p>When ſpecial Committees appointed for the drawing of ſome one ſpecial Bill,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> preſent the ſame ready drawn to the Houſe, it hath been often ſeen, that the ſame Bill hath not only been twice read, but order'd alſo to be engroſſed the ſame Day.</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:97470:162"/>
               <p>It is not without Precedent that a Bill hath been thrice Read,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and paſſed in the ſame Day. But this is a Preſident that ſtandeth alone. <hi>Q.</hi> the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Attainder.</p>
               <p>A Bill was read the fourth Time,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Simon d'Ewes Jour.</hi> 90. Co. 1.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it paſs'd the Houſe, and tho there want not other Preſidents, yet it is rare and worth the Obſervation.</p>
               <p>A Bill was put to the Queſtion,<note place="margin">Id. 335. Col. 1.</note> upon the firſt Reading, and rejected; but it is not uſual for a Bill to be put to the Queſtion upon the firſt Reading.</p>
               <p>27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1584.<note place="margin">Id. 337. Col. 2.415. Col. 2.</note> A Bill was committed upon the third Reading, having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly committed upon the ſecond; which is not uſual.</p>
               <p>A Bill may be preferr'd to be ſecondly read the next Day after the firſt Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">Hakewel <hi>143.</hi>
                  </note> but the uſual Courſe is to forbear for two or three Days, that Men may have more Time to conſider upon it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Nature of the Buſineſs be ſuch, that it requireth haſte.</p>
               <p>After the Bill is ſecondly read,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>Clerk,</hi> as before, in humble Manner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the ſame to the <hi>Speaker;</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain readeth the Title and his <hi>Breviat,</hi> as he did upon the firſt Reading; which done, he declareth, <hi>That it was a ſecond Reading of the Bill.</hi> And then he ought to pauſe a while, expecting whether any
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97470:162"/>of the Houſe will ſpeak to it; for before the <hi>Speaker</hi> hath ſo declared the State of the Bill, no Man ſhou'd offer to ſpeak to it; and then, and not before, is the Time when to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>If after a pretty diſtance of Time,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> no Man ſpeak againſt the Bill for matter or Form, he may make the Queſtion for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing thereof, if it be a Bill originally exhibited into the Commons Houſe.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe if divers ſpeak for the Bill,<note place="margin">Id. 144.</note> without taking Exception to the (Matter or) Form thereof, he may make the ſame Queſtion for the ingroſſing.</p>
               <p>The like Queſtion for the ingroſſing ought to be made,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> if the greater Voice be, <hi>That the Bill ſhould not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> for it were to End further delay in the proceeding of the Bill, if there be no Exception taken to the matter or Form thereof: but upon the ſecond Reading, and after the <hi>Speaker</hi> hath deliver'd the State thereof, the Houſe doth uſually call for committing of the Bill; and then if any Man will ſpeak againſt it, either for Matter or Form, he ought to be heard.</p>
               <p>After the firſt Man hath ſpoken,<note place="margin">Id. 144.</note> the <hi>Speaker</hi> ought to reſt a while, expecting whether any other Man will ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: ſo ought he likewiſe to do after
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:97470:163"/>every Speech ended: when he perceiveth that the Debate is at an End, he ought then to make the Queſtion for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thereof, in this ſort:
<q>As many as are of Opinion that this Bill ſhall be committed,<note place="margin">Id. 145.</note> ſay <hi>Yea.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And after the Affirmative Voice given,
<q>As many as are of the contrary Opinion, ſay <hi>No.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And he ought by his Ear to judge which of the Voices is the greateſt: if that be doubtful, the Houſe ought to be divided.</p>
               <p>If upon Diviſion of the Houſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Numbers are equal,<note place="margin">Ibid</note> the <hi>Speaker</hi> hath the caſting Voice upon all Queſtions.</p>
               <p>If it appear that the Affirmative Voice be the greater,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> then ought he to put the Houſe in Mind touching the naming of Committees, which is done thus.</p>
               <p>Every one of the Houſe that liſt may call upon the Name of any one of the Houſe to be a Committee, and the Clerk ought in his Journal to write under the Title of the Bill the Name of every one
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97470:163"/>ſo called on, at leaſt of ſuch whoſe Names (in that Confuſion) he can diſtinctly hear; and this he ought to do without Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, either to thoſe that name, or to the Party named.</p>

               <p>After a Bill,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which is ſent from the Lords, is twice read, the Queſtion ought to be for the Commitment: if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to be committed, it ought to be read the third time, and the next Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be for the Paſſage, and not for the Ingroſſing (as it is where the Bill originally begins in the lower Houſe) for Bills, which come from the Lords come always engroſſed.</p>

               <p>After the Debate is ended,<note place="margin">Id. 250.</note> the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ought to put the Queſtion for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing.</p>

               <p>When the Bill is read the third Time,<note place="margin">Id. 153</note> the Clerk delivereth it to the Speaker, who reads the Title thereof, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Effect of the Bill, and telleth them, <hi>That the Bill hath now been thrice read, and that with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he will put it to the Queſtion for the paſſing;</hi> but pawſeth a while, that Men may have Liberty to ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; for upon the third Reading the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is debated afreſh, and for the moſt part it is more ſpoken unto this Time, than upon any of the former Readings.</p>

But,</p>
               <p>This Meſſage for Non-receſs was not well pleaſing to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Phillips</hi> firſt reſented it;<note place="margin">Poſt. 366.</note> and too Notice, that in 12 <hi>&amp;</hi> 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like Intimation, the Houſe reſolved it was in their Power to adjourn itſelf, or ſit. Hereafter, ſaid he, this may be put upon us by Princes of leſs Piety. Let a Committee conſider hereof, and of our <hi>Right</hi> herein, and make a Declaration. And accordingly, this Matter, touching his Majeſty's Pleaſure about the Receſs, was referred to a Committee, and to conſider the Power of the Houſe to adjourn itſelf,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:97470:183"/>to the End that it being now yeilded unto, in Obedience to his Majeſty, it might not turn to Prejudice in Time to come.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſpoke to the ſame Purpoſe, and ſaid, I am as tender of the Privileges of this Houſe, as of my Life; They are the Heart-Strings of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> The King makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation; but this Houſe adjourns itſelf. The Commiſſion of Adjournment we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read, but ſay, this Houſe adjourns itſelf. If the King write to an Abbot for a <hi>Corody</hi> for a Valet, if it be <hi>ex rogatu,</hi> though the Abbot yeilds to it, it binds not. Therefore I deſire that it be entered, that this is done <hi>ex rogatu Regis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon a Meſſage was ſent to the King, That the Houſe would give all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to his Majeſty's Service, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Purpoſe of Receſs.

               <p>Hereupon the King ſent for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant of the Houſe; but he was detained, the Door being locked: Then he ſent the Gentleman-Uſher of the Lords Houſe, with a Meſſage; and he was refuſed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, till the ſaid Votes were read. And then in much Confuſion the Houſe was adjourned till the 10th of <hi>March,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it was intimated from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>In Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> (of <hi>Lincoln's Inn</hi>) his Argument for Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> he ſaid, the ſecond Charge in the Information againſt him, was the Contempt to the Command of the King's <hi>Adjournment, Jac.</hi> 18. It was queſtioned in Parliament, whether
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:97470:184"/>the King can adjourn the Parliament (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be without doubt that the King can prorogue it.) And the Judges reſolved, That the King may adjourn the Houſe by Commiſſion; and 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was reſolved accordingly.</p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerved and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruſh.</hi> Vol. I. in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix. pag. 48.</note> that none was then impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for moving that Queſtion. And it is to be noted, that they reſolved that the Adjournment may be by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but did not reſolve, that it may be by a verbal Command, ſignified by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and it derogates not from the King's Prerogative, that he cannot ſo do, no more than in the Caſe of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8. that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant one Acre of Land by <hi>Parol.</hi> The King himſelf may adjourn the Houſe in Perſon, or under the Great Seal, but not by verbal Meſſage, for none is bound to give Credit to ſuch Meſſage; but when it is under the Great Seal, it is <hi>Teſte meipſo.</hi> And if there was no legal Command, then there can be no Contempt in the Diſobedience of that Command. In this Caſe no Contempt appears by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for the Information is, that the King had Power to adjourn Parliaments. Then put the Caſe the Command be that they ſhould adjourn themſelves; this is no Purſuance of the Power which he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:97470:185"/>to have. The Houſe may be adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Ways, to wit, by the King, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Writ, or by the Houſe itſelf; the laſt is their own voluntary Act, which the King cannot compel; for <hi>Voluntas non co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur.</hi>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:97470:214"/>to be true: But to exclude Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> from being one of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was objected againſt him, That he was Outlawed in Debt; which was true; <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet,</hi> he was outlawed for ſixty Pound the 31ſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at the Suit of one <hi>Johnſon,</hi> which Debt was paid; and alſo the 39th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> at the Suit of one <hi>Hacker</hi> for ſixtteen Pounds, which Debt was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo paid; and that (notwithſtanding) this the King, by the Advice of his Council at Law, and by the Advice of his Judges, took Cogniſance of theſe Outlawries, and directed another Writ to the Sheriff of the ſaid County, to elect another Knight in the Place of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn,</hi> which Writ bore Date before the Return of the former.</p>

            <p>And at laſt Day of the Return, to wit, the firſt Day of the Parliament, both Writs were return'd; the firſt with the Indenture ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <p>And the Court of Parliament, after a long Debate thereupon, gave Judgment, That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> ſhould be received: And their Reaſons were theſe;</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe they took the Law to be, That an Outlawry, in Perſonal Actions, was no Cauſe to diſable any Perſon from being a Member of Parliament; and it was ſaid, That this was ruled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:97470:215"/>35th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the Parliament Houſe, in a Caſe for one <hi>Fitz-Herbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Precedent, was 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Pardons of the 39th of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> had pardoned thoſe Outlawries; and therefore, as they ſaid, he was a Man able againſt all the World, but againſt the Party Creditor, and againſt him he was not. But in this Caſe the Parties were paid.</p>
            <p>Alſo, Thirdly, it was ſaid, That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> was not legally outlawed, becauſe no Proclamation was iſſued forth to the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> where he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant and Reſiant: And therefore the Outlawry being in the Huſtings in <hi>London,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> being Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in <hi>Bucks,</hi> the Outlawry (no Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation iſſuing to the County of <hi>Bucks</hi>) was void by the Statute of the 31ſt of the Queen; which, in ſuch Caſes, makes the Outlawries void.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It was ſaid that the Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were,
<list>
                  <item>1. Againſt <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Againſt <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> Gent. And,</item>
                  <item>3. The Return was of <hi>Francis Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> Knight.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="419" facs="tcp:97470:215"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Et quomodo conſtant,</hi> that thoſe Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn?</hi> For theſe Reaſons alſo they reſolved, That the Outlawries were not any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn,</hi> to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to be a Knight for the County of <hi>Bucks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, It was ſaid, That by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which preſcribes the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Election of Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, it is Enacted, <hi>That the Election ſhall be by Indenture between the Sheriff and the Freeholders; and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture ſhall be the Return of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was alſo ſaid, That the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do warrant this Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. One Precedent of 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. where a Perſon outlawed was adjudged a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Member of Parliament. Another 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and at that Time one <hi>Gargrave,</hi> who was a Man learned in the Law, was Speaker, and of the Queen's Council.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another was the Caſe of one <hi>Fludd,</hi> in the 23d of the Queen, who, being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, was adjudged, That he ſhould be privileged by Parliament; and at that Time the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Popham</hi> was Speaker. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the 35th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there were three Precedents, <hi>ſcil.</hi> one of <hi>Fitz-Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi> another of one <hi>Killegrew,</hi> being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:97470:216"/>in fifty two Outlawries; and the third of Sir <hi>Walter Harecourt,</hi> being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed in eighteen Outlawries.</p>
            <p>But after this Sentence and Judgment of the Parliament, the King's Highneſs was diſpleaſed with it, becauſe the ſecond Writ <hi>emanavit</hi> by his Aſſent, and by the Advice of his Council.</p>
            <p>And therefore it was moved to the Judges in the Upper-Houſe,<note place="margin">Note,</note> 
               <hi>Whether a Perſon outlawed could be a Member of Parliament; who gave their Opinions that he could not.</hi> And they all, except <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> agreed, That the Pardon, without a <hi>Scire facias</hi> did not help him, but that he was outlawed to that Purpoſe, as if no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don had been granted.</p>
            <p>And upon this the Lords ſent to the Lower-Houſe, deſiring a Conference with them concerning this Matter; which Conference the Lower-Houſe, after ſome Deliberation, denied, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they had given their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before; and therefore they could not have <hi>Conference de re Judicata;</hi> as in like Manner they did 27 Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon a Bill that came from the Lords, and was rejected by Sentence upon the firſt Reading, Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> being then of the Privy Council, and of the Houſe.</p>
            <pb n="421" facs="tcp:97470:216"/>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe they ought not to give any Accompt of their Actions to any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer the Lords did ill reſent; and therefore refuſed Conference in other Matters concerning Wards and Reſpite of Homages and Purveyors; and alſo they ſent to the King to inform him of it. But before their Meſſengers came to the King, two of the Privy Council, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> Sir <hi>John Stanhope,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Herbert,</hi> were ſent to the King by the Lower-Houſe, to inform him that they had heard that his Grace was diſpleaſed with the Houſe, for their Sentence given for Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn,</hi> as well as in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sentence; which was, (as they heard) ſaid to be againſt Law; as alſo for the Manner of their Proceedings, being done haſtily, without Calling to it either Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> or his Council, or without making his Grace acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>And therefore they deſired his Grace to underſtand the Truth of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and alſo told him, That they were ready, with his good Leave, with their Speaker, to attend his Majeſty, to give him Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>But the King told them they came too late; and that it ought to have been done ſooner, calling the Houſe Raſh and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate:
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:97470:217"/>But yet notwithſtanding, he was content to hear their Speaker in the Morning at Eight of the Clock.</p>
            <p>Upon this Meſſage, Committees were choſen to conſider of the Things and Matters aforeſaid, which ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the King, in Satisfaction of the Sentence given by the Houſe, (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were conſidered of, and digeſted by the Speaker and Committees,) in three Points, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the Reaſons and Motives of their Reſolutions.</item>
               <item>2. In the Precedents, which were thoſe I before have reported.</item>
               <item>3. And in Matters of Law.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Which were thoſe Matters of Law alſo before reported by me, with another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</p>
            <p>That in the Time of <hi>Henry the Sixth,</hi> the Speaker of the Parliament was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, in Execution, at the Suit of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and the Queſtion being put to the Judges at that Time,<note place="margin">See <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hun</hi>'s Col. p. 277.</note> 
               <hi>Whether the Speaker ought to have his Privilege,</hi> it was ſaid by them, <hi>That they were Judges of the Law, and not Judges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons and Motives were the free Election of the County; the Requeſt of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:97470:217"/>one of the Houſe; the double Return of the Sheriff, with a Commemoration of the Length of the Time ſince the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries; and with that the Payment of the Debts.</p>
            <p>To this Report the King anſwered, That he now ought to change his Tune which he uſed in his firſt Oration, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> Thankſgiving, to Grief and Reproof. But he ſaid, That it was as neceſſary they ſhould be reproved, as congratulated; and therefore he cited a parcel of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein God had ſo done with his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nay, with King <hi>David,</hi> the People whom he tendered as the Apple of his Eye; and <hi>David,</hi> who was a Man after his own Heart.</p>
            <p>He ſaid,<note place="margin">It ſeems antiently, to be a Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with being a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Publick Counſellor.</note> That ſince Sir <hi>Francis Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> was received by the Houſe upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Motives inducing the Houſe thereunto, ſo the King, upon Reaſon too, took Conſideration of Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> being one of the Council, an ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, a Counſellor not choſen by the King, but by his Predeceſſors, and ſo he found him; and therefore he endeavoured to grace him, being the only Man of them that had been diſgraced, the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that he would not for any Thing in the World, offer unjuſtly any Diſgrace to any Man in the Nation. Beſides, he did not proceed raſhly, as they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:97470:218"/>but upon Deliberation, with double Advice, as well with that of his Council, as with that of his Judges.</p>
            <p>And in his anſwering the Precedents,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quere,</hi> If the King himſelf was not here, too over ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> he ſaid, <hi>That thoſe were his own proper Records;</hi> and to uſe them againſt himſelf was over-great Weenings: But in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, he ſaid, that they ought to reſpect Times and Perſons; and therefore ſaid, That <hi>Henry the Sixth</hi>'s Time was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he himſelf Weak and Impotent. And as for the other Precedents, they were in the Time of a Woman, which Sex was not capable of Mature Deliberation; and ſo he ſaid where Infants are Kings, whom he called Minors.</p>
            <p>For the Law Part, he referred to the Anſwer of his Judges; who, by the Lord Chief Juſtice, gave theſe Reſolutions: They all unanimouſly agreeing in them;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the King alone, and not the Parliament Houſe, had to do with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of the Members of Parliament; for from him the Writs iſſued, and to him the Sheriff is commanded to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns; but when a Man is returned and ſworn, the Parliament-Houſe hath to do with him, and the Sheriff ought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Outlawry, if he knew it before his Return.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They reſolved clearly, Thatan out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Perſon cannot by the Law be a
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:97470:218"/>Member of the Parliament-Houſe; but for that Cauſe the King might refuſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of him; and for that Cauſe he was removable out of the Houſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Chief Juſtice ſaid, That in the 35th of <hi>Henry the Sixth</hi> it was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in Parliament; which anſwers the Precedents vouched by the Commons of that Time. And alſo he ſaid, That in the firſt Year of <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> it was adjudged in Parliament, That Perſons outlawed, or attainted, could not ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without Reſtitution by Act of Parliament. And he ſaid, That though the Books do not warrant his Saying, yet the Parliament Roll (which he had ſeen) does warrant it, which any Man might ſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They reſolved, at the Inſtance of the King himſelf, That the Party could not be diſcharged from the Outlawry without a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> ſued againſt the Party Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, Plantiff in Debt; and Juſtice <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> for that Purpoſe recanting his former Opinion, ſaid, That he, upon peruſing of his Books, and by Reaſons of the Law, was of Opinion with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the Statute of the 31ſt of the Queen, concerning Proclamation to be made in the County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they all reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as before Times it had been reſolved, That no Outlawry by that Statute was
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:97470:219"/>void until a Judgment, declaring, That there was no Proclamation iſſued forth to the County where the Party was Reſiant at the Time of the awarding of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As for the Statute of 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. which enacts, That the Indenture ſhall be only the Return of the Sheriff, the Judges ſaid, That was true, that ſuch was the Statute, and that that was his Return for ſo much; but that Statute doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Sheriff from returning any other Thing material which diſables the Parties choſen.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It was held, That the Indorſement of the Writ, comprehending the Matter of the Outlawry, was material, and not a Nugation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And, laſtly, they reſolved, That by the Return of the Sheriff, it apeared that Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> was the ſame Perſon who was outlawed 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by the Name of <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> Eſquire; and 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by the Name of <hi>Francis Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> Gentleman; and that by the Words of the Return, <hi>ſcilicet, Idem Franciſcus Goodwyn Miles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tlagatus exiſtit,</hi> &amp;c. And they alſo agreed, That no Perſon outlawed ought to have his Privilege of the Parliament-Houſe; and that all the Precedents vouched by the Commons were after the Parties were Members of the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:97470:219"/>Houſe, and not before they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe Reſolutions, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> the Reſolution of the Judges, the Commons Houſe hold clearly; That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> was well received into Parliament; and the King commanded them to confer together, and reſolve, if they could, of themſelves; and if they could not reſolve, to confer with the Judges, and then to reſolve; and when they were reſolved, then to deliver their Reſolution to his Council, not as Parliament-Men, but as his Privy Council, by whoſe Hands he would receive the Reſolution; and for that Purpoſe he left them behind him, (he himſelf being to ride to <hi>Royſton</hi> a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.) And to purſue the Commandment of the King, the Commons Houſe clearly reſolved, That what they had done, was well and duly done; and they were of Opinion clearly againſt the Judges, as to the Matter of the Outlawry, and that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> of the Precedents: And alſo that the Parliament only had to do with the Sheriff's Returns of Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that the Returns ought not to be made till the firſt Day of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore They would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the Judges: But they appointed a Committee to conſider of the Reaſons to be delivered to the Council for the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:97470:220"/>of the King; which Committee, by the Aſſent of all the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſent to the Lords this Reſolution following, <hi>videlicet,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what the King taxed the Houſe for, That they meddled with the Sheriff's Return of Members of Parliament, being but one half of the Body, the Lords being one, and the principal Part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Body.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Note.</hi> This Reſolution was writen in Parchment, and ſo delivered to the Council of the King, not as Parliament-Men, but repreſenting the King's Perſon; and, a Copy thereof was kept in the Houſe.</note> As to that they anſwered; That all Writs for the Election of Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were returned into the Parliament-Houſe before 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. (at which Time it was enacted, That all ſuch Returns ought to be made in <hi>Chancery;</hi>) and that appeared by the Records from the Time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Firſt,</hi> until the ſaid Year of the Seventh of <hi>Henry the Fourth.</hi> And therefore the Parliament muſt of Neceſſity have only meddled with the Returns till the making of the ſaid Statute of the Seventh of <hi>Henry the Fourth;</hi> at which Time the Place of the Return was altered, and enacted to be in <hi>Chancery;</hi> but yet that did not take away the Juriſdiction of the Parliament, to meddle with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:97470:220"/>of the Members of Parliament; but that remained as it was before. And this was manifeſt, as well by Reaſon as by Uſe: For that Court is to meddle with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, where the Appearance and Service of Members is to be made and uſed; but in the Parliament only the Appearance and Service are to be made and uſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Parliament only are the Returns to be examined and cenſured.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, ever ſince the making of the ſaid Statute of the Seventh of <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> the Clerk of the Crown attends the Parliament every Day till the End of it, with all the Writs and Returns; and at the End of the Parliament, he brings them into the Petty-Bag.</p>
            <p>The Precedents alſo do warrant this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddling with Returns for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the Twenty-ninth of the Queen, a Writ iſſued forth to the Sheriff of — who made a Return before the Day into <hi>Chancery;</hi> and the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> upon that Return containing ſuch Matter, as this Writ now contains, ſent a ſecond Writ to the ſaid Sheriff; who thereupon made a new Election; and that ſecond Writ was alſo returned, and both the Writs and Returns brought into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and there cenſured by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>That the firſt ſhould ſtand; and that the ſecond Election was void;</hi> and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:97470:221"/>that the <hi>Chancellor</hi> hath no Power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a ſecond Writ, nor to meddle with the Return of it; and divers other Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were ſhewn by the Commons to the ſame Effect, <hi>videlicet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Nine and twentieth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> one.</p>
            <p>And in the Three and fortieth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> another.</p>
            <p>And in the Thirty fifth of the Queen two.</p>
            <p>Whereof one was upon the Return of the Sheriff, that the Party firſt elected was Lunatick; and thereupon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment examined it; and upon Examination thereof they found the Return true, and gave a Warrant for another Writ.</p>
            <p>As to the Matter, That they were but one half of the Body; to that they ſaid, That though in the making of Laws they were but an half Body, yet as to Cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Privileges, Cuſtoms, Orders, and Returns of their Houſe, they were an entire Body; as the Upper Houſe was for their Privileges, Cuſtoms, and Orders, which continual and common Uſage hath approved of.</p>
            <p>As to their Charge of having uſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy and Raſhneſs, they anſwered; That they uſed it in ſuch a Manner as in all other Caſes they were wont to do, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="431" facs="tcp:97470:221"/>
            <p>To have firſt a Motion of the Matter in Controverſy; and then they cauſed the Clerk of the Crown to bring the ſecond Day the Writs and Returns; and they being thrice read, they proceed to the Examination of them; and upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave Judgment; which was the true proper Courſe of the Place.</p>
            <p>As to the Houſe's not having uſed the King well, the Thing being done by his Command, they ſay, That they had no Notice before their Sentence, that the King himſelf took any ſpecial Regard of that Caſe; but only that his Officer, the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> had directed his ſecond Writ, as formerly had been done.</p>
            <p>As to the Matter of the Outlawry, they ſaid, That they underſtand by his Royal Perſon more Strength and Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from it, than ever before; and yet it was without Example, That any Member of the Houſe was put out of the Houſe for any ſuch Cauſe; but to prevent that, they had prepared a Law, That no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Perſon, for the Time to come, ſhould be of the Parliament; nor any Perſon in Execution, ſhould have the Privilege of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But they ſaid further, That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> was not outlawed at the Day of his Election; for he was not <hi>Quinto Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actus,</hi> the five Proclamations never had
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:97470:222"/>been made; which Proclamations they in <hi>London</hi> always ſpare, except the Party, or any for him, require it; and that Exigent was never returned, nor any Writ of <hi>Certiorari</hi> directed to the Coroners to certify it, but after his Election; which was a Thing unuſual, (the Money being paid, and the Sheriffs being long ſince dead,) to diſenable the ſaid <hi>Goodwyn</hi> to ſerve in Parliament; that the Exigent was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Names of the deceaſed She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs put thereto. <hi>Et ex hoc fuit,</hi> without doubt that <hi>Goodwyn</hi> could not have a <hi>Scire Facias;</hi> for there was no Outlawry againſt him, and by Conſequence the Pardons had diſcharged him.</p>
            <p>And they farther ſhewed to the King, That if the <hi>Chancellor</hi> only could exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Returns, then upon every Surmiſe, whether it were true or falſe, the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> might ſend a ſecond Writ, and cauſe a new Election to be made; and thus the <hi>free</hi> Election of the County ſhould be abrogated; which would be too dangerous to the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>For by ſuch Means the King and his Council might make any Man, whom they would, to be of the Parliament-Houſe, againſt the <hi>Great Charter</hi> and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England.</hi>

Whereas, on the contrary, in that (very firſt) Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Majeſty, they found, That the whole Freedom of the Parliament and

            <p>To conclude this Treatiſe, as I begun it, give me leave to add, There is nothing ought to be ſo dear to the Commons of <hi>Great Britain</hi> as a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> that
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:97470:223"/>is, a <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> every Way free and independent either of the Lords or Miniſtry, or, <hi>&amp;c.
